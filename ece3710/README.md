## Setup

The Quartus project files need to be generated by running the `setup_project.tcl` script. This will place all of the project files in a directory called `build`.

The script can be executed by running the following commands:

```
$ cd <path_to_repository>
$ quartus_sh -t setup_project.tcl
```

Alternatively, you can run the script from the Quartus Tcl console. Open Quartus, close any open projects, and then click on View > Utility Windows > Tcl Console to open the Tcl console. The script can be executed by running the following commands in the Tcl console:

```
tcl> cd <path_to_respository>
tcl> source setup_project.tcl
```
